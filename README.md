# React Apollo Demo Project

Demo project with React-Apollo v3.0 beta and AWS AppSync & Amplify used to create a serverless GraphQL backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Initialize a Backend

Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/react#install-and-configure-the-amplify-cli).

```
$ amplify configure
```

1. Set up Amplify

```
$ amplify init
```

2. Install Amplify libraries

```
$ npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

3. Setup the frontend (add code in `src/index.js`)

```
import Amplify from "aws-amplify";
import awsExports from "./aws-exports";
Amplify.configure(awsExports);
```

4. Add a GraphQL API and automatically provision a database

```
$ amplify add api
```

5. Deploying the API

```
$ amplify push
```

6. Check Amplifyâ€™s status

```
$ amplify status
$ amplify console api
```

The fronted is now ready to be connected to the API using the API key.
